        <h1 class="margin-bottom-30">About us</h1>
        <p class="main-p">FlatPig is a weightlifting program and lifestyle, dedicated to strength training, so people can eat whatever they want without getting too fat. </p>

        <p class="main-p">With almost 20 years of weightlifting experience, our founder has worked long and hard to find a perfect balance between strength training and eating really good food. Make no mistake about it, if you’re looking to get shredded or super fit… you have came to the wrong place. </p>

        <p class="main-p">The FlatPig lifestyle is focused on one thing, being able to eat whatever you want, without getting too fat. Hence our tagline, “Be a flat pig, not a fat pig.” </p>

        <p class="main-p">In order to have the freedom of eating whatever you want, you have to reverse engineer how that’s possible. What we’ve done is put together an incredible workout and diet program that allows you to do just that. </p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20 margin-top-30"><strong>Why we created this product</strong></h3>
        <p class="main-p">If you look on the internet, there are a ton of incredible fitness guru’s out there sharing valuable information. For example: </p>

        <p class="main-p"><strong>Jay Cutler: </strong> One of, if not the best bodybuilder of all time, has a show on the internet. He talks about what his routine is and what it took to become such a great body builder. </p>

        <p class="main-p"><strong>Rich Froning: </strong>Known as the fittest man on earth, has several documentaries out there that shares how hard he works.</p> 

        <p class="main-p"><strong>CT Fletcher: </strong> My personal favorite, and the strongest man you’ve never heard of. </p>

        <p class="main-p">These three guys are inspiring, talented, dedicated, etc., but they all have one thing in common. They are all extremely dedicated to being fit as a full time job. Over here at FlatPig, we’re honestly don't think the juice is worth the squeeze. We're simply not willing to give up great food. If you're goal is to be world class, please go follow them, and not us. </p>

        <p class="main-p">For the other people (our research shows it’s over 85%) in the world are not training to be a world class athlete, you've come to the right place.</p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20 margin-top-30"><strong>How the program works</strong></h3>
        <p class="main-p"><strong>Eat -</strong> Follow our moderately strict diet plan.</p>

        <p class="main-p"><strong>Lift -</strong> Follow our incredible weightlifting program (this is actually pretty legit)</p>

        <p class="main-p"><strong>Track -</strong> Use this app to track your lifts</p>

        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20 margin-top-30"><strong>Why you will love this program</strong></h3> 
        Over time, you will find that our lifestyle is very scalable. The workouts don’t take too long and even kids love our diet plan. That means you can live your life and be strong at the same time. You know those people who eat to live? Well, we live to eat, and at the same time, we realize how important it is to be healthy. </p>

        <p class="main-p">As of now, heart disease is responsible for more deaths in America than anything else. We don’t have any real data on this, but our assumption is that it’s due to lack of exercise and a poor diet. Which, we totally understand. There is good food everywhere. People should be able to eat a cheeseburger and fries without worrying if they’re going to clog their arteries, right? </p>

        <p class="main-p">Think about all of those diets and lame fitness companies out there. They say things like “you can eat this cake,” or “you can eat this lasagna.” You get all excited, order the food from an infomercial, and when it arrives you realize it’s the size of a golf ball…. then you get pissed. </p>

        <p class="main-p">There are also a lot of really weird and healthy diets out there that work really well. Then, you realize they taste like dog poop. Noticing this epidemic, we decided to do something about it. That’s why we finally decided to tell the world about the FlatPig lifestyle. </p>


        <h3 class="margin-bottom-20 margin-top-30"><strong>Now, there are some things you need to know before getting into this program.</strong></h3>

        <p class="main-p">We're not doctors, or personal trainers, or nutritionists. We made this program up based on our own experience. So if you get hurt, or the program doesn't work it’s your own fault. We warned you.</p>
        <p class="main-p">You need a gym. We believe it’s better to have one in your garage, so you don’t have to spend time driving back and forth. We’re about those compound lifts, so you don’t need much. However, gym go-ers will like this program as well.</p>
        <p class="main-p">This app doesn’t actually do much. Based on the main compoud lifts, you can enter in how much weight you lifted that day. Our next release, we plan on building something that allows everyone in the world to compete in everything. For now, we wanted to keep it simple.
        <p class="main-p">All the app does is track the weight you enter, so you can see how much you get stronger over time.</p>
        <p class="main-p">Obviously, that means this is a strength program, so if you are looking for some 20 minute ab program, go somewhere else. </p>
        <p class="main-p">The diet we have implemented is actually pretty legit. It’s a common theory, and a lot of real athletes follow this method. We do too, but only 4.66 days a week. </p>
        <p class="main-p">The weightlifting program is pretty legit. That is, if you’re into that dad-bod, mom-mode look.
